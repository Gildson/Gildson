## Hi, I'm Gildson Santos

Data Engineer with solid experience in the area of ​​technology and artificial intelligence, working with a focus on Big Data solutions, data engineering and machine learning. I currently work as a Data Engineer at ArcelorMittal Sistemas, contributing to the development and maintenance of large-scale data pipelines, using tools such as Databricks, Spark and Azure Data Factory.

My career includes relevant experiences as a Senior Python Developer at JediCRM, where I worked on the creation of AI models applied to computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). Before that, at Inovall, I was responsible for mining and processing data from web scraping, inserting it into relational databases with the support of frameworks such as Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

I also worked at Posto Seguro Brasil, where I developed and improved web applications using the Bubble platform, creating modules such as legal and e-commerce, in addition to providing direct support to the end customer. At the beginning of my career, I interned at the Civil Police of Rio Grande do Norte, working with network infrastructure, user support and systems development with technologies such as ASP.NET, PHP, Java and various databases.

I have a degree in Computer Engineering from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte and I have certifications in Apache Airflow, Databricks, Artificial Intelligence and Azure Data Factory. Proficient in Portuguese and English, I continue to improve my technical skills and contribute to high-impact solutions in data engineering and AI.
